### **Template Breakdown**:

1. **File Summary Section**:
   - For each file, it outputs:
     - Path of the file.
     - Programming language.
     - File size.
     - Last modified timestamp.
     - A portion of the file content (truncated to 1000 characters to keep it concise).
   
2. **Key Components Section**:
   - For each file, lists out the main functions and classes.
   - Descriptions of major functions or classes and their responsibilities.
   
3. **File Relationships Section**:
   - Highlights relationships between different files, functions, and classes. This is important for the AI to understand how files interact, which is necessary for generating a proper diagram.
   
4. **Mermaid Diagram Requests**:
   - Provides specific instructions for generating different types of diagrams:
     - Class Diagrams
     - Sequence Diagrams
     - Flowcharts
   
5. **Focus Areas**:
   - Specifies key focus areas for the AI model to concentrate on when generating the diagram, such as relationships, function calls, and data flow.
